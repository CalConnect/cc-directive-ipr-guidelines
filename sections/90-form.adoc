=== Terms and definitions

free of charge::
patent holder will not seek any monetary compensation as part of the licensing arrangement (whether such compensation is called a royalty, a one-time licensing fee, etc.); patent holder is still entitled to require that the implementer of the relevant CalConnect standardization deliverable sign a license agreement that contains other reasonable terms and conditions (such as those relating to governing law, field of use, warranties, etc.); does not indicate that the patent holder is waiving all of its rights with respect to a patent, but only on the issue of monetary compensation

patent::
claims contained in and identified by patents, utility models and other similar statutory rights based on inventions (including applications for any of these) solely to the extent that any such claims are essential to the implementation of a CalConnect standardization deliverable

essential patent::
patent is essential to implement a specific CalConnect standardization deliverable

patent holder::
person or entity that owns, controls and/or has the ability to license patents

reciprocity::
patent holder shall only be required to license any prospective licensee if such prospective licensee will commit to license its patent(s) for implementation of the same relevant CalConnect standardization deliverable free of charge or under reasonable terms and conditions

assignment/transfer of patent rights::
licensing declarations made pursuant to
<<CC10003,clause="5.2">> or <<CC10003,clause="5.3">>
shall be interpreted as encumbrances that bind all
successors-in-interest as to the transferred patents.
Recognizing that this interpretation may not apply in all
jurisdictions, any patent holder who has submitted a licensing
declaration according to <<CC10003>> --
be it selected as <<option-1,a)>> or <<option-2,b)>> on the
"`Patent statement and licensing declaration for CalConnect deliverables`" --
who transfers ownership of a patent that is subject to
such licensing declaration shall include appropriate
provisions in the relevant transfer documents to ensure
that, as to such transferred patent, the licensing
declaration is binding on the transferee and that the
transferee will similarly include appropriate provisions
in the event of future transfers with the goal of binding
all successors-in-interest

Lore Unt (Apple):

Suggest that the “licensing negotiations” text below be as it is in the ITU guidelines, rather than in the form.
////

////
Free of Charge:: The words "Free of Charge" do not mean that the Patent Holder is waiving all of its rights with respect to the Patent. Rather, "Free of Charge" refers to the issue of monetary compensation; i.e., that the Patent Holder will not seek any monetary compensation as part of the licensing arrangement (whether such compensation is called a royalty, a one-time licensing fee, etc.). However, while the Patent Holder in this situation is committing to not charging any monetary amount, the Patent Holder is still entitled to require that the implementer of the same above document sign a license agreement that contains other reasonable terms and conditions such as those relating to governing law, field of use, warranties, etc.

Reciprocity:: The word "Reciprocity" means that the Patent Holder shall only be required to license any prospective licensee if such prospective licensee will commit to license its Patent(s) for implementation of the same above document Free of Charge or under reasonable terms and conditions.

Patent:: The word "Patent" means those claims contained in and identified by patents, utility models and other similar statutory rights based on inventions (including applications for any of these) solely to the extent that any such claims are essential to the implementation of the same above document. Essential patents are patents that would be required to implement a specific deliverable.

Assignment/transfer of Patent rights:: Licensing declarations made pursuant to Clause 2.1 or 2.2 of the Common Patent Policy for ITU-T/ITU-R/ISO/IEC shall be interpreted as encumbrances that bind all successors-in-interest as to the transferred Patents. Recognizing that this interpretation may not apply in all jurisdictions, any Patent Holder who has submitted a licensing declaration according to the Common Patent Policy - be it selected as option 1 or 2 on the Patent Declaration form - who transfers ownership of a Patent that is subject to such licensing declaration shall include appropriate provisions in the relevant transfer documents to ensure that, as to such transferred Patent, the licensing declaration is binding on the transferee and that the transferee will similarly include appropriate provisions in the event of future transfers with the goal of binding all successors-in-interest.
