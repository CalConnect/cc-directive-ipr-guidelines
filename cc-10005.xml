<p id="_f74a7c17-146f-417a-be7f-38a342ab3651">Multiple declaration forms are appropriate if the patent holder wishes to identify several patents and classifies them in different options of the declaration form for the same deliverable or if the patent holder classifies different claims of a complex patent in different options of the declaration form.</p>

<p id="_f6b5ae3c-8388-48b2-b751-2aea49f3030a">The patent information databases may contain information on specific patents, or may contain no such information but rather a statement about compliance with the patent policy for a particular deliverable.</p>
<p id="_6083e692-3797-4c95-9e2f-4a399fb6dd1f">The patent information databases are not certified to be either accurate or complete, but only reflect the information that has been communicated to CalConnect.</p>
