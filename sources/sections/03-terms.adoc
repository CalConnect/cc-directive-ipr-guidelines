However, while the Patent Holder in this situation is committing to not charging any monetary amount, the Patent Holder is still entitled to require that the implementer of the relevant deliverable sign a license agreement that contains other reasonable terms and conditions such as those relating to governing law, field of use, warranties, etc.
